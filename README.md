# Working With Otp

This project showcases the practical use of <span style="color:skyblue">Agent</span>, <span style="color:aquamarine">Task</span>, and <span style="color:lightcoral">GenServer</span> in Elixir. Each module is demonstrated through specific examples and use cases, highlighting their roles in managing state, performing background tasks, and implementing server processes. 

The project aims to provide a clear understanding of these essential Elixir concepts and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.
